        <h3>About</h3>
          <p>Hi, this is my website where I share all of my work (good or bad, hopefully the former). I am hugely passionate about learning, good reasoning, and, above all else - <u><b><i>cars.</i></b></u></p>
          <br>
          <p><b><u>So what prompted your website?</u></b></p>
          <p>I took up the advice from Matt Might's superb page (the link is <b><a href="http://matt.might.net/articles/what-cs-majors-should-know/">http://matt.might.net/articles/what-cs-majors-should-know/</a></b>) on what Computer Science majors ought to do. Also, I fancied being able to show off my HTML and CSS skills. Not to mention it's a handy way of storing my work and other personal stuff!</p>
          <br>
          <p><b><u>Are you really that passionate about cars?</u></b></p>
          <p>Yes. With a capital Y, E, and an S for good measure.</p>
          <br>
          <p><b><u>What about learning and good reasoning?</u></b></p>
          <p>You truly cannot have enough of either in your life, I think.</p>
          <br>
          <p><b><u>What would be your life motto and how would you describe your outlook on life?</u></b></p>
          <p>Never be a hypocrite - I always thought failing to follow through on what you believe, say or do is the biggest and probably most tragic failing of any individual. </p>
          <p>My outlook on life would probably be: very strongly rooted in rationality (if you asked me to respect a blatantly irrational view, for instance, I probably wouldn't do so); will always surrender to a stronger argument; and I think friends are the best thing you can have (aside from a nicely-specced Noble M600 or Ariel Atom V8). I also have an absolutely massive streak of curiosity and a nice helping of scepticism to balance it out!</p>
          <br>
          <p><b><u>Why don't you give us a little essay on yourself?</u></b></p>
          <p>Of course, strangely-attentive visitor! I graduated from King George the Fifth School in Hong Kong in the summer of 2014. After that and getting my grades I got into St Andrews university to take Philosophy and Economics as my major. The way the module credits worked suggested I had two more modules to pick after my compulsory credits for my major.</p>
          <p>My mother, who was going through a bit of a techno phase at the time, suggested I do Computer Science, which initially I laughed at. To give you context - it was a miracle for me when I managed to turn the telly on. Now my mother was telling me to take a course in something explicitly centred around technology.</p>
          <p>After some thought, though, I decided to do it. It sounded like a pretty cool subject, incredibly useful for our times and, just maybe, I might finally put one of my biggest weaknesses to rest. So I put myself down for a single module in Computer Science in the first term, and Management in the second.</p>
          <p>However, that set-up wasn't to last. Funnily enough, with life's strange sense of humour, I absolutely fell in love with the funny little world of numbers and strings. It was traumatising and exhilarating in equal measure and I don't think I ever put half as much effort into a subject as I did Computer Science for those few months. I loved it. So, after some deliberation on the matter, I decided to take it over Management in the second term as well.</p>
          <p>I took a lot more capability to the field in the second semester, so it didn't have the novelty of the first term. But it was clear this wasn't a fling, but a real love affair. So I began to ponder if maybe I should continue with it beyond the first year, and that's what ended up happening. I swapped faculties and changed my major, currently undecided on whether to have it with Philosophy or Economics. I love all three, but Computer Science has stolen my heart, and it's a void method because I don't think it's going to give it back for a while yet.</p>
          <p>And that's pretty much up to the present moment really. I'm working on Logect this summer, which is a response to the (frankly dire) lack of ease in understanding the field of Logic, specifically Propositional Logic. The details for that are attached in the readme file in the download file on my Portfolio page.</p>
          <p>With regards to what I want to do, I know that cars will play a role in some form in the future. How exactly I haven't decided, although software engineer in a car firm sounds like a pretty awesome role. Alternatively, working at a place like Google would be pretty sweet too.</p>
