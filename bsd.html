        <h3>Why? How?</h3>
          <p>In June 2015 I was very keen to get a job (as you do when you're a university student). My substantial love for Computer Science had flourished to the point where a job in the sector was both appealing and practical. 
          <br>
          <p>Thanks to my dad I was able to get in touch with a friend of his that got me in touch with a coding school called BSD Academy, which is based in Hong Kong. Stands for '<strong>B</strong>eyond <strong>S</strong>kin <strong>D</strong>eep. Snazzy name, I'm sure you'll agree. Clich√©d though this may sound, I do have to say I admire the philosophy behind it. It sounded like a good place to develop myself and hopefully other people in the process.</p>
          <br>
          <h3>What? When? Where?</h3>
          <p>Uhhh...</p>
